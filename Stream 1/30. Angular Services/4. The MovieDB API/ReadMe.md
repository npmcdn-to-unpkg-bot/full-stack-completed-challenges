**COMPLETED CODE**  
The code for this lesson can be found
at <https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/full_stack_solutions/tree/master/Stream-1/Unit29-angular_services/the_moviedb_api>

 

Contains The MovieDB API example in the solution folder.

 

Note to view this example you will need to open a command window in the root
folder and run ‘npm start’ this will install the node\_modules folder which will
in turn run a local mini server allowing us to view and test our angular js app.
