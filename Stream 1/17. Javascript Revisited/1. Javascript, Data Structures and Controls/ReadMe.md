CHALLENGE
=========

 

We want to take some text and remove certain words from a paragraph of text. The
steps will involve splitting the text into an array of words. Then iterate over
the words and remove those words that are contained in a separate array. You can
start by using the following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
var profile = “I am a web developer developing in html css and javascript”;
var stops = [“i”,”am”,”a”,”and”]; //words to be removed from profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

These challenges were performed in google chrome developer tools console and
also repl.it, however you can see the actual JavaScript examples provided by
code institute for the lesson in the solutions folder.
