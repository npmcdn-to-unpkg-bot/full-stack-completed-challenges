Challenge
=========

 

Create a new file in Sublime Text and add the HTML and CSS code shown below.
Follow the steps we looked at in the Code Creation Cycle. Take your time, watch
out for typos, and if all else fails you can copy and paste the code from here.
We don’t recommend doing that though. The best way to get up to speed with
coding is through repetition and practice, and for a while, that means typing
similar stuff out again and again until it all starts to fall into place. Play
around with the CSS values. Notice that we’ve used more than one way to assign
color.
