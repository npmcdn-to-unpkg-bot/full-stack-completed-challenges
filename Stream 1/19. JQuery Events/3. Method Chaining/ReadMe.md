CHALLENGE
=========

 

**Challenge A:**

Download Sample-Site.zip from the lesson folder. Unzip and bring up the folder
in sublime. Make changes to the script.js file for the jQuery code.

**Part 1:** Apply the following behaviour to the blue button in the button.html
file:

-   Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a
    Red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in
    the html).

-   Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the
    Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.

-   On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.

-   On mouseleave reverse the above.

-   Use method chaining to achieve the above.

**Part 2:**

-   When the button is clicked, make the paragraph slide up. When clicked again,
    make it slide down.

This is a real world example of how jQuery can be used on a button or on a menu
item.  
  


**Part 3:**

-   Now try hide()/show() and fadeIn()/fadeOut() on button click.

-   Create a second button and paragraph.

-   Run the code and click on the buttons.

You will notice that both buttons perform the same action on both paragraphs.
Even if you mouse over one button, both are highlighted (if you still have the
mouseover code).

Why?

Because for now, our jQuery code says so.  
  
  
**Challenge B:**

-   Go to [eir.ie](https://www.eir.ie/)

-   Using Developer tools to change all the links (hrefs) so they point
    to [codeinstitute.net](http://www.codeinstitute.net/).
