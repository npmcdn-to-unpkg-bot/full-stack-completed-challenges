CHALLENGE
=========

Â 

Using the card panel example we worked on in the last lesson:

-   Inside your script.js file, add a click event which will trigger when a
    \<p\> tag is clicked and will change the color of all \<p\> tags to red. You
    can use the .css() function at first.

-   When a \<h2\> is hovered over, the background of all \<h2\>s are changed to
    the colour lightblue.

-   When a \<h2\> is hovered over its font size increases, but only for that
    particular \<h2\> (hint: add an id to the \<h2\>).

-   When a button is hovered, the background color of the page turns black.

-   When a button is no longer hovered, the background color of the page turns
    grey.
