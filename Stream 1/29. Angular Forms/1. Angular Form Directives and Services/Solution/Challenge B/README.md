# Angular Forms 

This project is a skeleton application to learn the basics of angular routing

To clone the application use the usual git clone command from a command tool:

`git clone https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/angular-forms.git`


Once that command has been completed you should see the project in a folder named *angular-forms*.

In order to run this code, you will need to run the following commands:

1. `cd angular-forms`
2. `npm install -g http-server` 
	* *NOTE: If you are running on Windows, you will need to make sure that you're running the command tool as administrator. If you're using Mac OS X or Linux, make sure to run it as root using `sudo npm install -g http-server`*

Once the above steps have been completed, you should be able to run the following command:

`npm start`

This should serve up the content, so you can now open up your browser and in the URL bar enter `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
