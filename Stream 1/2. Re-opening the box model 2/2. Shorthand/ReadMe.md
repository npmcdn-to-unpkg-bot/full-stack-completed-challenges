CHALLENGE
=========

 

Now that you have seen how block and inline-block can work, we can get cracking
on some real layouts.

Continuing from the last walk through code that you have written, try and
replicate the following layouts:

 

Make `block- level` and make the `width 100%`:

Remove background color:

Add headings & center them (text-align:center):

Here is the real challenge – create the layout as shown below:

-   Create `id`’s for the Sidebar and Content.

-   Make them `inline-block` and give them a `height` of `320px`.

-   Remove all margins from `.box` class for the moment.

-   Maths time – perform the `width` calculation to fit them inside the `960px`
    container.

-   Remember the `margin`s (`left` and `right`). Because we are using
    `inline-block` for styling, we need the `.container` class to have
    `font-size: 0`.

-   The `box` class should have a `font-size` greater than `0`.

 

If you have managed to create the above layout, well done!  
Save your work, it will be needed again.

 

*Optional:*
-----------

If you want to put the sidebar a little more to the left side, as shown below,
go ahead!
