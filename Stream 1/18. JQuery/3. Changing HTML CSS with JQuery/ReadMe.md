CHALLENGE
=========

 

**Challenge A:**

From the example we have been working on :

-   Try changing the content of all the paragraphs on the page in one go.

Go to [eir.ie](https://www.eir.ie/)

Use jQuery to :

-   find out the font-family used for paragraphs

-   find out the font family used for  \<h1\>’s

-   change the text of each \<h2\> to your name

Go to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/):

Use jQuery to change the following:

-   background color

-   font family for paragraph

**Challenge B:**

Continuing from the Challenge A:

-   Append a paragraph to every paragraph already on the page. (Some lorem ipsum
    text will be fine)

-   Remove all links from the page.

-   Empty all cards
