NOTE: These challenges consist of using the Balsamiq software program, the
solutions below are present in the solutions folder, I have also added the
solutions for previous lessons in this folder for viewing purposes although they
didn’t consist of challenges.

Taking what you have learned in this lesson, can you generate a Mockup similar
