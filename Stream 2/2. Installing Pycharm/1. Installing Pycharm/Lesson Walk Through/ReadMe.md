NOTE!!!!
========

 

Play the game a few times. Eventually **you’ll notice that something is going
wrong:** it always says too high and the number is impossible to guess. Unlike a
syntax error, there is no error message telling us where the problem is, so
we’ll have to try and work out what’s happening by using the debugger.
