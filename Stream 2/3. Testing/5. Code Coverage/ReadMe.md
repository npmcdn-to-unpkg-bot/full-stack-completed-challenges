### NOTE!!!!

This challenge is still a Work In Progress [WIP] and the repository will be
updated in due course. The reason for this is due to time limitations on the
course, I have also recently begun working night shifts, which has slowed my
course progress down. I have had no choice but to move forward with the course
materials, but will complete and update the challenge solutions as soon as
possible.

 

CHALLENGE
=========

 

-   Write some more tests and see if you can cover the entirety of the function.

-   Make the vending machine evil by not returning change when the item isn’t
    available, or returning slightly less change than it should.

-   Extend the program so that it takes a list of coins, not an amount.

-   Extend the program to deal with a machine that has run out of certain coins,
    for instance 20p.
