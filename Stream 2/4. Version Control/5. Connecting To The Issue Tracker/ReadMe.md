CHALLENGE
=========

 

### **Challenge A:**

Try and fix the bug. We need to check if the direction the user has input exists
in the`valid_directions` dict.

 

### **Challenge B:**

Try extending the program in one or more ways:

-   Add a map which is printed out after visiting each room. You could just use
    the first letter of each room as the symbol, i.e.:

    `H P`  
    `L`

-   Add a longer description for each room which will be printed out on entering
    it.

-   You’ll have to alter the structure of the locations dictionary, or create
    another dictionary to hold the descriptions.

-   Add some objects to each room, and allow the player to pick them up and
    carry them.
